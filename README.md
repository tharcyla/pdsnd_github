### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data 

### Description
This project uses Python to understand U.S. bikeshare data using data
provided by Motivate <https://www.motivateco.com/>.

The script is able to calculate statistics and build an interactive environment.
In this interactive environment, raw user input as answers to some questions will 
change the results: 
1. The city the user would like to see data from (there are 3 cities with available data)
2. Whether the user wants to filter by month, day, or both 
3. (If they choose month) which month
4. (If they choose day) which day
5. (If they choose both) which month and day

Afterwards, the script will: 
i. filter the data based on the answers; 
ii. display statistical data for the user;
iii. ask whether they want to see raw data displayed (5 lines at a time);
iv. ask whether they want to start again or exit.
